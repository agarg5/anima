This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features implemented
uses [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/arecvlohe/rbc-with-dnd-starter)
- drag event to change it's time or day. Can also change duration by dragging edges
- an edit name of event, create new event, or delete the event


## To Do with more time than 3 hours

- use tailwind (installed) to improve styling in general and especially of the edit event modal
